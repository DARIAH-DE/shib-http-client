shib-http-client
================

Minimalistic wrapper around the Apache HTTPClient adding Shibboleth support

A bit of naming first:

* IdP (identity provider) - the server who knows who you are
* SP (service provider) - the server who wants to know who you are

The process is roughly this:

1. You make a request to the SP
2. SP wants to know who you are
3. You ask IdP to prove your identity by giving you a ticket
4. You pass the ticket on to the SP
5. the SP replies to your request

The goal of this project is to perform the steps 2-3 for you.

This client aims to be minimalisic but functional. So the "features" are:

* *No IdP discovery* - a pre-defined IdP is used
* *No fancy logins* - login to the IdP happens via HTTP Basic authentication
* *No certificate checks* - it is easy to disable all certificate checks. If you don't disable 
this, make sure your Java environment knows about the certificates used by the IdP and SP.


Example
-------

<pre><code>
// Initialize OpenSAML
DefaultBootstrap.bootstrap();

// The last argument indicates to accept any certificate
HttpClient client = new ShibHttpClient(aIdpUrl, aUsername, aPassword, true);
HttpGet req = new HttpGet("https://my/protected/url");
HttpResponse res = client.execute(req);
... = res.getEntity().getContent(); // returns an InputStream
</code></pre>


Testing if ECP is enabled on the remote host
--------------------------------------------

If the client does not work as expected, you should check if the remote server does support ECP at
all. You can do this with a 'simple' command (replace URL with the URL you want to test):

<pre><code>
curl -k -I -H 'Accept: application/vnd.paos+xml' -H 'PAOS: ver="urn:liberty:paos:2003-08";"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:profiles:SSO:ecp"' URL
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 23 Oct 2013 10:54:36 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.17 (Linux/SUSE)
Expires: 01-Jan-1997 12:00:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 1356
Content-Type: application/vnd.paos+xml
</code></pre>

If the reply does not look approximately like this, in particular if the Content-Type line is not
there, then the remote host does not have ECP enabled and you cannot use this client to access the
host. Ask the administrator of the remote host to enable the ECP profile.
